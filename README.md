## Learning Points 


In this project, I learned about the different between for and while. This was something I was stuck on for a while. Another error I made that
I ended up learning a lot from was that I didn't have a lot of my code inside of my generatePassword() function. This led to me being very confused about why my code was not executing. I will probably make that mistake again but recognize it faster. I also was able to practice my general JavaScript formatting and mechanics and I can feel myself becoming more comfortable over time.
